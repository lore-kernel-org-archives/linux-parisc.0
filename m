I really don't know what's wrong as nothing should be different from
the old percpu allocator as seen from the arch code.

Kyle reported that the system didn't boot with the patch applied.
Access to a system would be nice but boot debugging usually is done
much easier with local access, so I was hoping he would follow up.
Kyle, do you have any details?

Thanks.
