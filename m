Sorry, I=E2=80=99ve lost it in first version. In short - memory layout =

exploited according to current implementation. All because mmap choose =
address=20
just before previously allocated segment. You can read more about it =

Some test are available here https://github.com/blackzert/aslur.=20
To solve the problem Kernel should randomize address on any mmap so
attacker could never easily gain needed addresses.

The value of this patch is to decrease successful rate of exploitation
vulnerable applications.These could be either remote or local vectors.
