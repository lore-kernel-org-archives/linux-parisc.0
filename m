Yes, we have all the machinery for a variable task_size, but we never
use it.

Right, so we have thread_info in %cr30, but we still seem to be using a
vestigial struct thread_struct as well as a struct thread_info (so we
don't have all the info at the right level).  I'll code user_max_addr as

(segment_eq(get_fs(), USER_DS) ? TMP_TASK_SIZE : ~0UL)

And do TMP_TASK_SIZE as

(test_tsk_thread_flag(tsk,TIF_32BIT) ? DEFAULT_TASK_SIZE_32 :
DEFAULT_TASK_SIZE)

until we can get this sorted out properly (i.e. by removing task_size
from struct thread_struct)
