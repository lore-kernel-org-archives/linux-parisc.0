Yes I agree. This is a significant limitation of first class virtual address spaces.
However, conflict like this can be mitigated by being careful in the application
that uses multiple first class virtual address spaces. If all threads make sure that
they never resize shared memory regions when executing inside a VAS such conflicts do
not occur. Another possibility that I investigated but not yet finished is that such
resizes of shared memory regions have to be synchronized more frequently than just at
every switch between VASes. If one for example "forward" memory region resizes to all
AS that share this particular memory region during the resize operation, one can
completely eliminate this problem. Unfortunately, this introduces a significant cost
and introduces a difficult to handle race condition.

What do you mean with *virtual address segments*? The nice part of first class
virtual address spaces is that one can share/reuse collections of address space
segments easily.
