Your comments about the si_codes caused me to look into how they differ
across the architectures and realize they also all need to be merged
into uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h for sanity sake.   In doing so I found
a couple of minor issues with my other unifications.

Rebased onto my tree your patch looks like the below.  If it does not
cause any regressions it looks like a perfect fix.  The noticable change
is that the first FPE si_code available across all architectures is 14
so I have used 14 instead of 10 for FPE_CONDTRAP.

Subject: [PATCH] signal/parisc: Add FPE_CONDTRAP for conditional trap handling

Posix and common sense requires that SI_USER not be a signal specific
si_code.  Thus add a new FPE_CONDTRAP si_code for conditional traps.

-- EWB rebased onto my tree.
