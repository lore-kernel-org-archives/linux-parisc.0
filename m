Um, no it doesn't, at least not in PCI.  It guarantees the write will
be issued by the memory system, but it may still be cached (called
posting) in the PCI bridge.  So it doesn't guarantee the write reaches
the device by the time it returns.

Right, the relaxed operator provides no guarantee of ordering between
the memory and IO domains.  However, it's only really a problem on
multiple memory controller systems (i.e. NUMA).  Parisc (except
superdome, which we don't support) doesn't have this problem.  We also
turn of CPU stream reordering, so compile order is retire order on our
CPUs (which makes life a lot simpler).

Well, with the volatile address it is.

The current implementations provide the expected semantics: namely the
position in the instruction stream is compile (retire) ordered and
issued from memory once retired.  We still do have the write posting
problem, but you'll find additional reads in the drivers to flush the
posted writes, so I don't actually believe we need anything changing.
