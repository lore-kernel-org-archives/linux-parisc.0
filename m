But the ia64 grows-up case is tested?

One thing I've considered is to get rid of the CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP
crap entirely in code, and instead just make the VM_GROWSUP #define be
0 for architectures that don't want it. The compiler should then just
automatically remove all the code that says

   if (vma->vm_flags & VM_GROWSUP) {
     ...

and the code would look more straightforward. Hmm?
