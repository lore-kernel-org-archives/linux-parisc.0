OK, so what happened is that prior to the map single fix

commit df46b9a44ceb5af2ea2351ce8e28ae7bd840b00f

    [PATCH] Add blk_rq_map_kern()


bio could only accept user space buffers, so we had a special path for
kernel allocated buffers.  That commit unified the path (with a separate
block API) so we could now submit kmalloc'd buffers via block APIs.

So the rule now is we can accept any user mapped area via
blk_rq_map_user and any kmalloc'd area via blk_rq_map_kern().  We might
not be able to do a stack area (depending on how the arch maps the
stack) and we definitely cannot do a vmalloc'd area.

So it sounds like we only need a blk_rq_map_vmalloc() using the same
techniques as the patch set and we're good to go.
