So for parisc, anywhere in smp_callin() should be fine.  Our last act on
CPU bringup before going into cpu_idle() is to enable interrupts.

I haven't yet actually tried git head on parisc (and I won't be able to
until I actually get my machines back [currently being shipped across
the atlantic]) but if there's a problem it will show up quickly:  parisc
actually uses cpu hotplug to boot its secondary cpus.
