Actually, ext3 (jbd) sent kmalloc'ed buffer to the block layer for
frozen data. xfs also used kmalloc'ed buffer. Neither do now (so, as
you said above, jbd wastes some memory when the block size is not
equal to page size, I think).

Agreed.

Note that network block drivers (iSCSI, drbd, something else?) doesn't
play with page ref-counting. They want to use sendpage. The network
layer (sendpage) can't handle non-ref-counted pages. The best solution
for fs and network block drivers might be modifying sendpage to handle
such pages.
