Do what I did on Sparc wrt. TASK_SIZE, that way you won't need to
include linux/sched.h

The only reason you need linux/sched.h is to get
test_tsk_thread_flag(), for your TASK_SIZE_OF().

But that's completely pointless for TASK_SIZE which only needs to look
at the current thread's settings.

Thus if you use test_thread_flag() for TASK_SIZE, instead of trying to
borrow TASK_SIZE_OF()'s implementation, you'll no longer have this
linux/sched.h dependency.
