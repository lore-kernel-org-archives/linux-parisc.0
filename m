Well your deliberate decision is crashing my box on boot.  That makes
this a regression from the IDE cmd64x driver. I hear indirectly there's
a similar problem on sparc.

Yes, I know ... but that config is broken today and a fix, given the
hardcoded assumptions in libata-sff, would be more invasive (and not
really of interest to the crash problem).

No, that analysis is wrong: Parisc (and actually presumably every
non-x86) doesn't use legacy mode.  The bars are all wired up (I posted
the original lspci output showing this).  The problem is that when you
try to prod the registers behind the secondary bar we get an instant
crash because the memory doesn't respond ... I'm assuming the secondary
bar isn't actually wired up to the chip.

You mean in ata_pci_bmdma_init_one()?  yes, that might work ... I still
need to know how to detect this.

The core libata code looked broken in the assumption that it had to poke
a double register pair for sff mode (the hard coded loop over two
ports) ... this is what won't work on non-x86 boxes.
