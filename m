Thank you for this pointer. I wasn't aware of this convention. I will change the
patches accordingly.

We also thought about this. However, we decided against implementing them as a
special purpose filesystem, mainly because we could not think of a good way to
represent a VAS/VAS segment in this file system (should they be represented rather as
file or directory) and we weren't sure what a hierarchy in the filesystem would mean
for the underlying address spaces. Hence we decided against it and rather used a
combination of IDR and sysfs. However, I don't have any strong feelings and would
also reimplement them as a special purpose filesystem if people rather like them to
be one.
