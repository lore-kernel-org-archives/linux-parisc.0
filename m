Some of the older MIPS systems are based on PC chipsets from Intel, OPTi
or others.  On those you can expect the parport_pc driver to actually work.
The ISA/PCI implementations are often between lackluster and pure brokeness
such as with non-functioning I/O port address space.  So I don't want to
run such drivers on such a platforms, things might turn ugly.

Embedded systems often have PCI but no PCI slots or there may even be an
apropriate SuperIO chip in the the system but nothing wired to the parallel
port bits.

And there are systems such as DECstations which have nothing that even
at a parsec's distance has a similarity to (E)ISA or PCI - but still
PARPORT_PC is offered along with 40 other options that depend on it.

There is no point in offering to build something that couldn't possibly be
used.  It just makes the kernel harder to configure and inflates the test
matrix for no good reason.
