Well, this is such a micro optimisation, is it really worth it?

If I map exactly to architectural operations, it's flush (without
invalidate if possible) before an outbound DMA transfer and nothing
after.  For inbound, it's invalidate before and after (the after only
assuming the architecture can do speculative move in), but doing a flush
first instead of an invalidate on DMA inbound produces a correct result
on architectures I know about.

Your logic assumes the cache line is dirty.  If you look at the XFS
usage, it never seems to do local modifications on a read, so the line
should be clean.  At least on parisc, a flush of a clean cache line is
exactly equivalent to an invalidate.  Even if there's some write into
the read area in xfs I've missed, it's only a few extra cycles because
the lines are mostly clean.
