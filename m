I am forwarding it to the reporter of the bug 9425 as this bug should be 
closed without changing the code.

A very similar case is for the bug 9424. I analyzed code for the Matrox
framebuffers and it is not worth changing. The idea behind the  pci_map_rom()
is that it enables and maps the ROM area. The Matrox framebuffer has
these two separated as the ROM may appear in the already mapped area.
The ROM is always enabled but not always mapped.

The only unification I see is to export pci_rom_enable/pci_rom_disable()
and use them inside the Matrox and sticore drivers (so no ioremap() 
is done but the code is shorter).

Regards,
Krzysztof
