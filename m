Um, but streaming APIs are what we use for all block and network I/O
from user space ... we don't see huge performance problems running up to
gigabits.  Even on parisc where we have to flush several times to make
this happen we can get up to several hundred megabytes per second.

OK, so this is the bit I don't get ... why isn't the streaming a problem
for I/O then, which even on arm wants far more than 200kb/s?
