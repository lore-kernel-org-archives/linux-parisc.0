Oh, I am sorry. I thought that you were referring to some other feature that I don't
know.

Yes, VAS segments provide a possibility to share memory regions between multiple
address spaces without the need to synchronize heap, stack, etc. Unfortunately, the
VAS segment feature itself without the whole concept of first class virtual address
spaces is not as powerful. With some additional work it can probably be represented
with the existing shmem functionality.

The first class virtual address space feature on the other side provides a real
benefit for applications in our opinion namely that an application can switch between
different views on its memory which enables various interesting programming paradigms
as mentioned in the cover letter.
