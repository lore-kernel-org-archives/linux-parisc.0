This is essentially a small tidy up from the previous series.  I
thought about the Ben H additions, but since power doesn't seem to
need this, they seemed a bit moot (we can expand the API when an
actual user comes along).

The patch series adds a flush/invalidate_kernel_vmap_range() API that
drivers using vmap/vmalloc areas must use before sending tohse areas
for I/O.  This makes it crystal clear that coherence on these areas is
the responsibility of the driver alone.  Fortunately xfs is the only
thing in the kernel actually doing I/O to vmap areas.

Sin ce xfs is completely broken on most VIPT architectures without
this, I'd like to submit it as a bug fix for 2.6.33.  Unfortunately,
we actually have some parisc xfs users whose data is curently at
severe risk.
