That never works though, we have lots of cruft left over from times when
that's happened and the conversion never quite got finished.

At least if you send out the patches to do the removal they might
eventually get merged.

Do you mind putting it in a topic branch (based on rc2) and then merge
that into the printk tree? That way I can merge the topic branch iff
there are conflicts later down the line towards 4.15.
