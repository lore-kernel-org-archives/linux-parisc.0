Um, so that's just so wrong it doesn't even seem possible.  It would
mean that a speculation could make a line dirty while DMA was in
progress to the underlying memory.  There's always going to be a window
between the DMA completion and the software invalidation where the dirty
line could be flushed, thus corrupting the DMA transfer.

Hopefully steps have been taken to see that whoever thought this was a
good idea isn't still contributing to the gene pool?
