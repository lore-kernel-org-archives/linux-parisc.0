I've been looking into problems with auto-loading the RTC driver on PPC=
 (more
specifically on PS3):
  - The recent "rtc-ppc" RTC class driver is not autoloaded by udev bec=
ause
    it's an old style platform driver that contains its own platform de=
vice.
  - The alternative old "genrtc" driver is autoloaded on non-udev syste=
ms only
    because it contains the module alias char-major-10-135. However, it=
's not
    a new-style RTC class driver.

=46ortunately there already exists a generic RTC class driver: "rtc-par=
isc".
Despite it's name, it's platform-independent, as it's build on top of t=
he RTC
abstraction used by "genrtc".

This patch series
  - adds a missing module alias to rtc-parisc,
  - renames rtc-parisc to rtc-generic,
  - converts the architectures that currently have CONFIG_GEN_RTC enabl=
ed in
    their defconfig (m68k, parisc, powerpc) to rtc-generic,
  - removes the obsolete rtc-ppc driver,
  - removes the old genrtc driver.
 =20
Note that genrtc may be used on other archictectures as well: at least =
alpha
has the required infrastructure ([gs]et_rtc_time()). The Kconfig rules =
allow
genrtc to be enabled on several others (cris, h8300, mn10300, um, x86, =
xtensa).

=46urthermore genrtc and rtc-generic are not 100% userspace compatible:
  - /dev/rtc provided by genrtc uses a misc character device (10:135),
  - /dev/rtc provided by rtc-generic uses a dynamic character device.
 =20
So perhaps we don't want to kill gen-rtc yet?

Any comments are welcomed!

With kind regards,
