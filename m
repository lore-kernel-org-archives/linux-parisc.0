Yeah, I think that would be a good thing to shoot for.  Even on PCs there are 
times when we need resource allocation to be done (or re-done) by the kernel 
for hotplug or just because the platform is pared down enough that it doesn't 
to it all by itself.

I might be able to find time to look into that myself in the next few weeks; I 
think we even have some open PCI bugs that could be solved by better resource 
allocation.
