XFS is a real user ... the XFS filesystem is our most trusted code base
that can break the 8TB limit, which hard disks are already at.  Ext4 may
be ready, but it's not universally present in enterprise distros like
XFS.

We need something that works for XFS.  The next proposal works for the
current block API because the vunmap makes the xfs pages look like
standard kernel pages, which blk_rq_map_kern() will process correctly.

But, in principle, I think whatever fix is chosen, we shouldn't
necessarily discourage others from using it.

This proposal has no block layer changes.  It just makes the XFS vmap
area look like a standard set of kernel pages ... with the overhead of
the page table manipulations on unmap and remap.

If it's just this route, they already exist ... they're vmap and vunmap.

OK, so that was illustrative.  The meat of the change is at the bio
layer anyway (fss tend to speak bios).  But the point of *this*
particular proposal is that it requires no changes either in the blk_ or
bio_ routines.
