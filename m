Actually it sounds like the right API design to me.  As a bonus it
should help performance a bit as well.  For example, the current
implementations of dma_sync_single_for_{cpu,device} and dma_unmap_page
on ARM while using the IOMMU mapper
(arm_iommu_sync_single_for_{cpu,device}, arm_iommu_unmap_page) all call
iommu_iova_to_phys which generally results in a page table walk or a
hardware register write/poll/read.

The problem, as you mentioned, is that there are a ton of callers of the
existing APIs.  I think David Vrabel had a good suggestion for dealing
with this:

However, I'm not sure whether the costs of having a parallel set of APIs
outweigh the benefits of a cleaner API and a slight performance boost...
But I hope the idea isn't completely abandoned without some profiling or
other evidence of its benefits (e.g. patches showing how drivers could
be simplified with the new APIs).
