That was copy paste from memory. You're right. There is a hex address.
I've copied a full message at the end of the email.

Yes, reverting this commit in 2.6.27 prevents kernel panic on both

Heres some more info from a printk:

Kernel panic - not syncing: arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c: I/O MMU @ 
c0000000fed01000 is out of mapping resources: pide:
