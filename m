Hi Geert,
FYI, I didn't followed any discussions or changes around the RTC drivers for parisc,
but Dann Frazier did some work on the parisc RTC driver as well.
His patches were merged (not upstream yet!) in Kyle's "rtc-parisc" branch at:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kyle/parisc-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=rtc-parisc

Not sure if they conflict (or are in sync) with your patches...
