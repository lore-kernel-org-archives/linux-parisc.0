Then we need to add all such chars to that regexp.

This is doable in asm, yes. For .bss, we need to not forget about
@nobits too: section .bss.foo,"aw",@nobits

I agree that it's not pretty, but otherwise we add fragility in other p=
laces:
every section directive must be correct now. These places are more nume=
rous
than linker scripts.

But, leaving aside the question whether we want to take the risk
of people forgetting to do it properly everywhere, -
is it even *possible* to specify these attributes in C - that is,
in gcc's __attribute__((section(".bss.foo")))?

I think currently gcc does not support it - it guesses attributes
based on the section name.
