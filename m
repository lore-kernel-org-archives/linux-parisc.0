CONFIG_HAVE_DMA_ATTRS is currently used to enable the functions to
set/get the DMA attribute values. Poking through the headers, it looks
like the struct dma_attrs is defined regardless of the
CONFIG_HAVE_DMA_ATTRS setting, so in that respect
we always seem to "have" DMA attributes (if we have DMA), but they may
not always be meaningful (ie. set to some value).
