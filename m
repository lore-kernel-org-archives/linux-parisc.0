 Many MIPS processors do have a reverse-endian control bit, which allows a 
user process to execute in the endianness opposite to the endianness the 
kernel runs in.  The feature has been around since 1991 and the R4000 CPU, 
however support is unlikely to be ever added to the MIPS/Linux port, due 
to the complexity required for byte-swapping all the data structures 
passed in memory between the kernel and the userland.  Does the PPC/Linux 
port actually implement this swapping?
