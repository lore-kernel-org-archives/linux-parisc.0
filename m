Slub is a subset of the kernel, so the original wording is a bit more
precise.

Well, we can discuss how to proceed going forwards.  The current fact is
that any prior kernel that enables SLUB with DISCONTIGMEM and !NUMA will
eventually go boom when the page allocator returns a page not in the
first pfn array.  That has to be fixed in -stable.  I don't really think
a DISCONTIGMEM re-engineering effort would be the best thing for the
-stable series.
