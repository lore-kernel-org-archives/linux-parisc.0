Well, in general chipset devices aren't required to support parity checking, 
AIUI; Intel gfx devices don't bother (PERR enable is hardwired to 0).

I'd have to ping our BIOS folks to see if that's the case, but I doubt it.  It 
would be a bad idea to disable any PCIe error reporting (including legacy 
error mapping) just because a gfx device was attached.  Apparently the AMD 
PCIe parts include PERR generation, so disabling upstream reporting at boot 
time seems like it would be an outright bug; it should be left up to driver & 
OS software.
