Hi Tim.

We agreed to get the common stuff and one architecture done before
proceeding with the rest.
Please stick to that plan so we avoid patch-bombing lkml + maintainers.

When we have this ready it will be a simple one-patch-per-arch to cover
the rest.

I will comment on your common patches for now.
