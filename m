From: James Bottomley <jejb@external.hp.com>

After looking through all the feedback, here's the next version of the
patch.

This one is based on a new api: flush/invalidate_kernel_vmap_range()
making it clear that the fs/driver is the entity managing the vmaps
... it also drops the block inputs because coherency management is now
the responsibility of the user.  The xfs interface is nicely
simplified with this approach.  Could someone check this on arm and
sh?

Thanks,

James
