Sure, but there's some rumors/oral traditions going around that some
block devices want bio address which are page aligned, because they
want to play some kind of refcounting game, and if you pass them a
kmalloc() memory, they will explode in some interesting and
entertaining way.  And it's Weird Shit(tm) (aka iSCSI, AoE) type
drivers, that most of us don't have access to, so just because it
works Just Fine on SATA doesn't mean anything.

And none of this is documented anywhere, which is frustrating as hell.
Just rumors that "if you do this, AoE/iSCSI will corrupt your file
systems".
