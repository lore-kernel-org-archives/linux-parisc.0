Yeah, but now only XFS passes vmap'ed pages to the block layer. Isn't
it better to wait until we have real users of the API?

Yeah, however we can make a rule that you can't pass a vmap area
(including vmap'ed pages) to the block layer. We can't make the rule
effective for the past so XFS is the only exception.

I'm not sure it's worth making the whole block layer compatible to
vmap (adding complexity and possibly performance penalty).

If we really need to support this, I like helper APIs that the callers
must use before and after I/Os.

btw, I'm not sure that the existing blk_rq_map_* API isn't fit well to
file systems since blk_rq_map_user and blk_rq_map_kern takes a request
structure.
