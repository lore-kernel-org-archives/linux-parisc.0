Trying to wire in a bridge blacklist looks a bit dicey ... unless you're
sure this is (and will always be) the only bridge?  How should this
wiring be done? most of the bridge checks just see if the bridge is in
the system rather than walking up the device tree; is that OK?

If not, what about just a legacy check on X86, so hedge with

if (legacy || !CONFIG_X86)

(or even just dump the legacy check, since you think everything is fine
on x86 today?)
