The correct terminology here would be to use observability. Yes, it can be
cached in whatever part of the system for some amount of time as long as
PCI device sees it in the correct order.

Let's do this exercise. 
1. OS writes to memory for some descriptor update
2. OS writes to the device via writel to hit a doorbell
3. Device comes and fetches the memory contents for the descriptor

writel() of PA-RISC needs to ensure that 3. cannot bypass 1. This is typically
done by a write barrier embedded into the writel() on relaxed architectures.

Good to know.

OK. I'll withdraw my patch. I'm just trying to ensure that all architectures
support writel() semantics. There is an attempt to remove unnecessary
write barriers from the drivers directory between the descriptor update and
writel. 

Just checking that PA-RISC won't break after this.
