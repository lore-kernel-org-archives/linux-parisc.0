In any case, it doesn't look like something that might be HPUX-related -
there r28 is not used for arguments or syscall number either, as far
as I can tell...

That's a side story, in any case; whatever the reason for restoring
r28, it only masks the bug with double restarts.  If you enter syscall
with r28 equal to e.g. -ERESTARTNOINTR, get the same value from sys_whatever()
and have a couple of pending signals, you will have syscall_restart()
called twice, each time seeing regs->gr[28] == -ERESTARTNOINTR and leaving
it unchanged.  regs->gr[31] will be decremented by 8 on each of those
calls, first time back to your syscall (correctly), then to the entry point
of the first handler minus 8.
