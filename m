alpha, mips, mn10300, powerpc, and x86 use pci_enable_bridges() via
pci_assign_unassigned_resources().  parisc uses pci_enable_bridges()
directly from lba_driver_probe().  I guess the other arches (except
arm) rely on firmware to enable bridge.

I think pci_assign_unassigned_resources() is a bit of an anachronism --
it's a boot-time thing that does it for all root buses at once.  A
more hot-plug oriented scheme would do it like parisc, where every
time we discover a root bridge, we do any necessary resource assignment
and bridge enablement underneath it.

For ARM, maybe that could happen in pcibios_init_hw() or something
similar.

I agree the SERR and PARITY stuff probably needs to remain arch code.
But it would be nice to at least have this and the bridge enable done in
similar places across arches.
