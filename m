seems like so far ppc is the only architecture attempting to implement it
correctly, all others either have it unimplemented or use the broken
by design set_rtc_mmss method. 
Also note that in most cases hwclock has much better possibilities
to do a good job.

Regarding genrtc vs rtc-ppc/rtc-generic it is worth noting that genrtc
provides RTC_UIE emulation which is of some use for exotic programs like 
"chrony".
Afaics this is also the only situation without a good userspace workaround 
and chrony never worked well for me so I have nothing against junking the 
code.

Regarding a possible reorganisation from the generic to all separate drivers
I agree that the habit of putting rtc-chip specific code in asm-generic is 
confusing at best. 
In many cases such code might be better placed in drivers/rtc or 
include/linux/rtc/chipname.

Imho this does not preclude the possibility to use a generic framework. While
there certainly are valid reasons to have separate drivers in some cases 
I do not see much value in rewriting everything as separate drivers where 
the generic framework works well.
