In commit 320b2b8de12698082609ebbc1a17165727f4c893
   mm: keep a guard page below a grow-down stack segment

we prevented stacks from growing downwards into other vma areas.
But some arhictectures (ia64 and pa-risc) have stacks that
grow upwards. Provide the same protection for them.

Pointed out to me by Matthew Wilcox.

DANGER, DANGER - NOT TESTED on pa-risc yet DO NOT APPLY WITHOUT AN ACK FROM PA-RISC LAND!

Are there any other architectures with upward growing stacks?
