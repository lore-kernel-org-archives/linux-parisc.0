So ... we've proven that people using these architectures use SLAB
instead of SLUB, don't enable CONFIG_DEBUG_VM and don't use hugepages
(not really a surprise ... nobody's running Oracle on these arches :-)

I don't think that qualifies as "barely any testing".  I think that's
"nobody developing the Linux MM uses one of these architectures".
