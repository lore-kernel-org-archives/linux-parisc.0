So I can solve my problem (autoloading the RTC driver on PS3 by udev) b=
y
converting the old genrtc driver into a platform device driver and crea=
ting
platform devices where appropriate.

However, this doesn't solve the distro's problem: as the old RTC framew=
ork
depends on RTC_LIB=3Dn, you cannot have both old and new RTC drivers in=
 your
(single) distro kernel. That's why dmwm2 created drivers/rtc/rtc-ppc.c:=
 Fedora
had to support machines with both old and new RTC drivers. As all of th=
e old
drivers are actually behind the ppc_md.[sg]et_rtc_time() abstraction, t=
his was
very easy.

Hence it's all or nothing, and we have to convert all of them.

drivers/rtc/rtc-generic.c would allow to have a working system without =
old
RTC drivers, until all low-level code has been converted to individual =
RTC
drivers.

IMHO these two generic frameworks are quite different: [sg]et_rtc_time(=
)
abstracts the low-level RTC hardware interface, while RTC class handles=
 the
interaction with userspace.
