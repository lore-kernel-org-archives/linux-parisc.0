So at this point for purposed of testing I don't think it matters which
number FPE_CONDTRAP gets as long as it is non-zero.

Everything finalized is in Linus's tree.  There is a patch pending
review on linux-arch that defines FPE_FLTUNK that looks to be useful
on several architectures.

I had probably misread our earlier exchange.  I had hoped you had tested
that FPE_CONDTRAP did not cause problems.

If that level of testing was complete I would have given FPE_CONDTRAP
the next FPE number and FPE_FLTUNK the one after.

As it sounds like FPE_CONDTRAP hasn't been tested enough to know if it
causes problems I will encourage the patches to be merged in the other
order.
