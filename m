I've hit "Mark as unread" twice on this thread now because I *am*
interested in this conversation.

However, I must confess that the original email reads like a rant
without a clear explanation of exactly what you think is wrong.

I'm familiar with the PARISC signal code because I worked on the
32/64-bit compat support for the frame layout, I also helped Randolph
work on the syscall restart logic.

What I don't understand is what's wrong with it now, and your subject
begins to hint at the problem.

Can you describe in more detail exactly what problem we need to solve?

Cheers,
Carlos.
