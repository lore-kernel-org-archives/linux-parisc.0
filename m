Sure - I'm not saying there isn't a problem just cautioning that there is
more to fixing it than blindly adding checks. If you simply check the
fields you break the split bridge boxes on x86. They aren't very common
these days but they probably outnumber PA-RISC Linux users 8)

Then your PCI configuration is faulty - no ?

I'd have thought the best way to fix that would be a PCI quirk for the
platform. However if it's multiple non x86 platforms being hit then the
driver probably needs the smarts to cope with this weird wiring.

Worked implementation example: drivers/ata/pata_via.c - see the use of
VIA_IDFLAG_SINGLE

I think that will do what you need ?
