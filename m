Sure, I can keep the comments in the .tbl file for all architecture. But
generated file doesn't have the comments.

In parisc, I'll go with the above model.

Let me bring another example from powerpc:

syscall_32.tbl,
136     common  personality                     sys_personality
         ppc64_personality   ---> 32-bit, compat (this is the current
model which I implemented)
syscall_64.tbl
136     common  personality                     ppc64_personality
                                       ---> 64-bit

I was wondering if the above table is right, how to arrange like parisc model?
FYI, there are some implement missing for SPU in powerpc

For your reference:
SYSX_SPU(sys_newfstatat,sys_fstatat64,sys_fstatat64)
SYSX_SPU(ppc64_personality,ppc64_personality,sys_personality)

Thanks
