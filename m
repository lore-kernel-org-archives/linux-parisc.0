That's normally done by pci_enable_bridges() called by
pci_assign_unassigned_resources(). (The later has a weird naming, it
does more than just assign unassigned resources in fact).

While that sounds like a good idea to generalize, I think it should
remain arch stuff tho, not move to generic code.

On some platforms, weirdo firmwares handle error handling and will be
unhappy if the kernel mucks around (such as pSeries).
