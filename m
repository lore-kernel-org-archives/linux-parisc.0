So you want us to kill the ppc_md.[gs]et_rtc_time() [ppc], mach_hwclk()=
 [m68k],
mach_gettod() [m68knommu] (and probably a few other) abstractions, and =
move all
RTC code out of arch/ into seperate drivers under drivers/rtc/ instead?

What about ppc_md.get_boot_time() [ppc]?
Please note that the functions above may also be used for very early cl=
ock
setting (e.g. time_init()) and in read_persistent_clock().
How should we handle these?

Even on x86 there seems to be way too much RTC logic in arch/x86/kernel=
/rtc.c
(e.g. mach_get_cmos_time()), which is duplicated in drivers/rtc/rtc-cmo=
s.c
through the inline function __get_rtc_time() in include/asm-generic/rtc=
=2Eh
(clever, hardware-specific stuff in asm-generic ;-)

I know. But it's a userland-visible change, so I wanted to explicit poi=
nt to
it.
