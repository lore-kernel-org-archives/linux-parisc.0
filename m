Good catch, I didn't see that in my earlier review. I agree we want the
files to be identical to the version they replace, so the macros need to
be there for now.

We may later decide to clean this up and remove all __NR_* that have
no entry point, but the conversion to the new table format needs to
otherwise be a nop.

+1

In general, I'd argue we want to keep all the nontrivial comments that
were present in either unistd.h or syscall_table.S.

I think I would prefer to have the compat table be generated with the '32'
abi rather than the '64' abi, so we end up with

108     32      pread64                         parisc_pread64
   parisc_pread64
108     64      pread64                         sys_pread64

I think this makes more sense, in particular on the other architectures
that have different macro names in some cases. When we do this,
the entries could get compressed to

108     32      pread64                         parisc_pread64
108     64      pread64                         sys_pread64

As others have commented several times, Firoz still needs to fix
the missing newline.

Firoz, please fix all the newlines before you repost any further
patches.
