No.

I want you to stop polluting <linux/module.h> with total and utter crap.

Please tell my WHY the hell you have

in your patch? What the _hell_ does that have to do with "module.h"?

Why the heck don't you just have that in the ONLY place that cares, namely 
lib/vfprintf.c?

In other words, WHY did you do something as stupid and totally 
unexplainable as

	diff --git a/lib/vsprintf.c b/lib/vsprintf.c
	index d8d1d11..0c47629 100644

	-               ptr = p;
	-#endif
	-       return ptr;
	-}
	-

when that thing _used_ to be in a place where it made sense? Why didn't 
you just change that already existing code to use a #ifdef instead?

Why do you move that to <linux/module.h>? It makes no sense.

And why do you put the arch-specific defines in <asm/module.h>? That makes 
no sense either. WHY?

As far as I can tell, the _only_ reason you happened to pick 
<linux/module.h> was literally that it is the first of our header files 
that lib/vsprintf.c includes. And quite frankly, that makes no sense. 

That's about as sensible as putting it into <linux/string.h>. 

Put those things in some _sane_ place. That means:

 - default non-implementation in lib/vsprintf.c, since there is no point 
   in putting it anywhere else, when it's not used anywhere else.

 - arch-specific implementations can go into some more sensible asm header 
   file that is more relevant. Maybe <asm/processor.h>?

IOW, I'm complaining about your totally senseless and apparently random 
choice of location.
