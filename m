Generally libc does not have a view of the current vm maps, and thus
in passing "random numbers", they would have to be uniform across the
whole vm space and thus non-uniform once the kernel rounds up to avoid
existing mappings. Also this would impose requirements that libc be
aware of the kernel's use of the virtual address space and what's
available to userspace -- for example, on 32-bit archs whether 2GB,
3GB, or full 4GB (for 32-bit-user-on-64-bit-kernel) is available, and
on 64-bit archs where fewer than the full 64 bits are actually valid
in addresses, what the actual usable pointer size is. There is
currently no clean way of conveying this information to userspace.
