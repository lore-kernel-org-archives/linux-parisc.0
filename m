OK, serial-8250 is clearly just plain wrong, since the 8250 series UARTs
are ubiquitous across just about every platform.

Floppy is special (in the short bus sense), since it is closely tied to
ISA DMA.  Conditionalizing this on ISA DMA makes total sense.

Parallel port is an intermediate case... Centronics parallel ports
predate the PC ecosystem by quite a bit, and the particular arrangement
of ports became popular with the PC and spread to other platforms, but
the particular variant of it known as ECP (as opposed to EPP) is ISA DMA
specific.

Now, isn't that was iowrite/ioread was designed for?
