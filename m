I meant just have the comments in the .tbl file, but not act on them.
One way to do this would be to let the script ignore everything
past the first '#' character in a line by passing it through 'sed -e "s:#.*$::"'
or a similar step (there is probably a nicer way to do this with
shell built-ins).

I would expect the above to actually be more important on other
architectures. E.g. on powerpc:

291     32    fstatat64        sys_fstatat64      sys_fstatat64
291     64    newfstatat     newfstatat

or (simplified)

291     32    fstatat64        sys_fstatat64
291     64    newfstatat     newfstatat

makes much more sense than

291     32    fstatat64        sys_fstatat64
291     64    newfstatat     newfstatat           sys_fstatat64
