We don't actually have any bug reports in front of us that show anything 
else in the VM other than slub has issues with this configuration, so 
marking them as broken is probably premature.  The parisc config that 
triggered this debugging enables CONFIG_SLAB by default, so it probably 
has gone unnoticed just because nobody other than James has actually tried 
it on hppa64.

Let's see if KOSAKI-san's fixes to Kconfig (even though I'd prefer the 
simpler and implicit "config NUMA def_bool ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE" over 
his config NUMA) and my fix to parisc to set the bit in N_NORMAL_MEMORY 
so that CONFIG_SLUB initializes kmem_cache_node correctly works and then 
address issues in the core VM as they arise.  Presumably someone has been 
running DISCONTIGMEM on hppa64 in the past five years without issues with 
defconfig, so the issue here may just be slub.
