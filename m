I don't think that works for XFS as it stands. Unmapping across
IO would have to guarantee we remap the buffer at the same
address after IO because we currently assume that mapped address
of the buffer can't change while references are held on the buffer.
That seems like an awful lot of complexity compared to the few lines
of code in XFS and the arches needed to support this.

We play lots of tricks in XFS to avoid mapping buffers when we can
because of the performance impact it has.  Nick Piggin's recent
work getting vmap to scale helped a lot, but it is still best to
avoid mapped buffers where possible.

Personally I see nothing wrong with the original patch series. If
the block layer mods are contentious, then just drop that patch
until a real need is brought to life.

Cheers,
