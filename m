So the parisc architectural feature is simply a statement of fact for VI
cache architectures: if you don't have a TLB entry for a page, you can't
do cache operations for it.  We have a software TLB interrupt and the
CPU can't interrupt for a speculation, so it's restricted to the
existing TLB entries in its cache for speculative move ins.

So now we know what the problem is, if arm can't operate this way,
what's your suggestion for fixing this ... I take it you have a DMA
coherence index like we do that flushes the cache on DMA ops?
