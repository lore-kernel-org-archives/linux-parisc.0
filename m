Well, it's more a question of how we want the Linux APIs to look.
Should passing vmalloc/vmap areas into the I/O routines be wrong?  Right
at the moment it doesn't work but xfs is the only consumer.

There are definite reasons to say yes: greater flexibility for handling
large buffers which logging filesystems seem to need.

My position is either xfs is right and we should handle them correctly
(and hence all the APIs should handle them correctly including
bio_map_kern) or xfs is wrong and we should try and make it work with
current APIs (which would necessitate a large contiguous physical
allocation ... with all the associated problems).  I chose the former
with this patch.
