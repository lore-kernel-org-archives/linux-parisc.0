VAS segments are first class citizens of the OS similar to processes. Accordingly, I
would not see this behavior as a bug. VAS segments are a kernel handle to
"persistent" memory (in the sense that they are independent of the lifetime of the
application that created them). That means the memory that is described by VAS
segments can be reused by other applications even if the VAS segment was not used by
any application in between. It is very much like a pure in-memory file. An
application creates a VAS segment, fills it with content and if it does not delete it
again, can reuse/open it again later. This also means, that if you know that you
never want to use this memory again you have to remove it explicitly, like you have
to remove a file, if you don't want to use it anymore.

I think it really might be better to implement VAS segments (if I should keep this
feature at all) with a special purpose filesystem. The way I've designed it seams to
be very misleading.
