I know.

rtc-generic is already in the kernel, it's just called rtc-parisc ;-)

So would you accept a patch series that:
  1. Adds the missing module aliases to rtc-parisc (which is a bugfix),
  2. Moves the platform device creation out of rtc-ppc and into arch-specif=
ic
     code (which is also a bugfix),
  3. Consolidates rtc-parisc and rtc-ppc into rtc-generic (which is a clean=
up),
  4. Makes rtc-generic dependent on PARISC, PPC, and M68K (the existing
     [sg]et_rtc_time() users):
       a. without introducing ARCH_HAS_GENERIC_RTC,
       b. with a big fat warning in the Kconfig comment not relaxing the
          dependencies, as it's supposed to go away.
  4. Converts the PS3 RTC support into a separate driver, called rtc-ps3
     (as a bonus ;-)

? If yes, I'll cook it up.

Other RTC platform support can be converted into separate drivers later.

Thanks!
