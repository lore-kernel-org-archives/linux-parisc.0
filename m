The streaming APIs are inefficient for this.  Consider the overhead of
having to writeback and invalidate caches at 200KB/s (which is what
you're requiring ARM to do).  That's far too much CPU overhead.

It's much more efficient to use non-cached memory for this on ARM.

We've been doing this for years and years, it's well proven.

Except with a rather large overhead of repetitive cache handling.
