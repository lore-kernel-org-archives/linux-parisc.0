Hi

quick reply from vacation as there are a few things i'd like to
comment upon.

yes it would be possible, i believe.

correct, this was something i was planning on trying at some point,
thanks for beating me to it ;)

your suggestion is good, but your patch does more than just
implementing, and there are a few things I'm not quite comfortable
with.

don't remove these defines please, i'd rather have every constants
defined in the header file. Personal taste... Besides, the comment is
very relevant to PA-RISC architecture, where no matter what the value
is, the minimum allocated space will always be at page size
granularity.

reading the patch through webmail doesn't help a lot getting a grasp
of its whole but i wonder if we could still find some debugging
purposes for these values. Remember this driver is work in progress ;)

ok i had removed these because i felt they were just bloating the file
and were sparsely used, but ok, it's nicer that way =3D)

again :)


This looks mostly good to me though I lack time to test and review it
more thoroughly. Hopefully I should be back later this month to give a
better look at it. I'd like to hear from Kyle as well.

Thanks for submitting this anyway.
