I meant sys_nanosleep would be covered by LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS, but
compat_sys_nanosleep would be covered by CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME
along with other compat syscalls.
So, if we define the LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS as


        "This controls the compilation of the following system calls:
        time, stime, gettimeofday, settimeofday, adjtimex, nanosleep,
alarm, getitimer,
        setitimer, select, utime, utimes, futimesat, and
{old,new}{l,f,}stat{,64}.
        These all pass 32-bit time_t arguments on 32-bit architectures and
        are replaced by other interfaces (e.g. posix timers and clocks, statx).
        C libraries implementing 64-bit time_t in 32-bit architectures have to
        implement the handles by wrapping around the newer interfaces.
        New architectures should not explicitly enable this."

This would not be really true as compat interfaces have nothing to do
with this config.

I was proposing that we could have LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS config, but
then have all these "deprecated" syscalls be enclosed within this,
compat or not.
This will also mean that we will have to come up representing these
syscalls in the syscall header files.
This can be a separate patch and this series can be merged as is if
everyone agrees.
