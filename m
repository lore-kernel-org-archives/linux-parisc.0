That is also true for ARM - you can't perform cache maintainence on a
page without there being a valid page table entry...

though this is where we differ, since the hardware walks the page tables
and doesn't require any interrupts to do this.

DMA on ARM continues to be totally non-coherent with the caches.  There
is no hardware help with this.  So, with these speculative accessing
CPUs, we will need to do software cache maintainence both before _and_
after the DMA in the case of DMA from device.

Maintainence before the DMA is required to ensure that the cache
doesn't write out dirty cache lines to the region which is being
DMA'd to.  Maintainence after the DMA is needed to invalidate any
stale data, whether it be pre-existing or speculatively loaded.

What this means is that we need to have the correct virtual address
in the unmap operation to ensure that subsequent CPU reads access
the newly DMA'd data.

The alternative solution I can see is to ensure that subsystems which
do DMA from (eg) vmalloc'd regions are not selectable for ARM.

It's also worth noting that we do have this restriction already in
place across _all_ ARM CPUs for the DMA APIs which take virtual
addresses - we only accept direct mapped kernel addresses via
those APIs since we use virt_to_phys() for L2 cache maintainence.
Walking page tables, especially with high PTE support (ARM has
joined those architectures supporting highmem), sounds to me very
unfunny.
