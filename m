    iomap: make IOPORT/PCI mapping functions conditional


is that if your architecture supplies pci_iomap/pci_iounmap, it expects
always to supply them.  Adding empty body defitions in the !CONFIG_PCI
case, which is what this patch does, breaks the parisc compile because
the functions become doubly defined.  It took us a while to spot this,
because we don't actually build !CONFIG_PCI very often (only if someone
is brave enough to test the snake/asp machines).

Since the note in the commit log says this is to fix a
CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP issue (which it does because CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP
supplies pci_iounmap only if CONFIG_PCI is set), there should actually
have been a condition upon this.  This should make sure no other
architecture's !CONFIG_PCI compile breaks in the same way as parisc.

The fix had to be updated to take account of the GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP
separation.
