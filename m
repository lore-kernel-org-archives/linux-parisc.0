Um, so that doesn't fix the compile failure.

The specific problem is that kmap_atomic no longer takes the index
argument because Peter moved it to a stack based implementation.  All
our kmap_atomic primitives in asm/cacheflush.h still have the extra
index argument which causes a compile failure.

To fix it, I had to run through a bunch of renames and extra argument
removals.
