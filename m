I like it.

We have the option of bringing either the ia64 or the frv si_codes
into the generic fold.  Is there any reason you choose frv?
Last I looked ia64 tended in many aspects to be well thought out,
and thus worth a careful look.

Given that a couple of weeks likely puts on the other side of the merge
window I would like to start with my patch so I can close the potential
copying of unitialized memory to userspace.  Then we can build yours on
top.

Although I am more than happy to add new si_codes now.

What I am in the final stages of testing and reviewing internally is the
change to merge all of struct siginfo, struct compat_siginfo,
copy_siginfo_from_user32 and copy_siginfo_to_user32 together.

I need another couple hours and I will be ready to post that.

For long term maintenance the more we can merge together the better,
as clearly some of these bugs have persisted far too long.  And getting
collapsing the arch specific si_codes into just a set of si_codes
looks like one more good step in that direction.
