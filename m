currently libata-sff is completely ignoring the enabled/disabled status
of the interfaces.  This is a real problem on parisc because if you
touch a non responding memory area (i.e. a disabled interface) you crash
the box.

Fix this up by restoring the enablebits logic to the pata_cmd64x driver.
To do this, libata-sff has to be modified not to probe both ports if we
don't have them.  This is done by reintroducing IDE_HFLAG_SINGLE flag as
ATA_HOST_SFF_SINGLE_PORT which drivers can use to condition libata-sff
port probing.
