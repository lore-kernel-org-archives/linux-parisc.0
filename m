As far as sound DMA goes, it's not about mailboxes.  It's about a circular
buffer which you want the device to DMA from direct to/from the DAC/ADC
and have the application write/read data directly to/from that same
buffer.

Without this, you end up having to copy the sound data - at something
around 200KB/s from applications into a driver managed buffer, which is
quite an unnecessary overhead for the CPU.
