Hmm. The BIO interface that the patch-series changes (bio_map_kern) 
doesn't work that way. It takes a "buf, len" kind of thing. That's what 
I'm complaining about.

Well, they clearly are _after_ this series, since that's what all those 
changes to __bio_map_kernel() and bio_map_kern_endio() are all about.

So I believe you when you say that XFS perhaps does everything right - I 
just think that the patch series in question actually makes things worse, 
exactly because it is starting to use virtual addresses.

I also think that the changes to bio_map_kernel() and bio_map_kern_endio() 
are not just "fundamentally ugly", I think they are made worse by the fact 
that it's not even done "right". You both flush the virtual caches before 
the IO and invalidate after - when the real pattern should be that you 
flush it before a write, and invalidate it after a read.

And I really think that would be all much more properly done at the 
_caller_ level, not by the BIO layer.

You must have some locking and allocation etc logic at the caller anyway, 
why doesn't _that_ level just do the flushing or invalidation?

I get the feeling that somebody decided that the whole "do DMA to/from 
vmalloc space" was somehow a common generic pattern that should be 
supported in general, and I violently disagree. Maybe XFS has good reasons 
for doing it, but that does emphatically _not_ make it a good idea in 
general, and that does _not_ mean that the BIO layer should make it easy 
to do for other users and have a general interface for that kind of 
crazyness.

IOW, I'm perfectly happy with the patch to fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_buf.c. 
That one still seems to use 'bio_add_page()' with a regular 'struct page'. 

But the fs/bio.c patch looks like just total and utter crap to me, and is 
the reason I refuse to pull this series.
