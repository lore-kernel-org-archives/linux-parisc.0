Here's version three of the patch.  This one makes sure the invalidate
works correctly.  I verified it on parisc by making my system print out
the virtual addresses it was invalidating and matching up with the ones
that were initially flushed, but since invalidate is a nop on parisc, I
can't verify live that the issue is fixed.  I'd really appreciate someone
from arm and sh testing here.

Thanks,

James
