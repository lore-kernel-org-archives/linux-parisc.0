Hmm, so that would seem to be a serious deficiency with the API then.

Yes, we used to have the same #ifdeffery, but in the alsa core ... I
can't remember how we fixed it for our two sound drivers (harmony and
AD1889).

The way we could fix this is by altering the kernel CPU address, using =
a
kmap area, so we have to change the virtual address by which the kernel
refers to this page to be coherent with user space, but the API is two
narrow to allow that, so perhaps we need to redesign how the API works.
