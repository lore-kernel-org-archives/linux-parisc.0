Sorry for late reply because of some urgent customer hotplug issues.

I am rewriting all change logs, and cover letter. Then found I was wrong
about the 2nd reason. The current kexec_file_load calls
kexec_locate_mem_hole() to go through all system RAM region, if one
region is larger than the size of kernel or initrd, it will search a
position in that region from top to down. Since kexec will jump to 2nd
kernel and don't need to care the 1st kernel's data, we can always find
a usable space to load kexec kernel/initrd under 4G.

So the only reason for this patch is keeping consistent with kexec_load
and avoid confusion.

And since x86 5-level paging mode has been added, we have another issue
for top-down searching in the whole system RAM. That is we support
dynamic 4-level to 5-level changing. Namely a kernel compiled with
5-level support, we can add 'no5lvl' to force 4-level. Then jumping from
a 5-level kernel to 4-level kernel, e.g we load kernel at the top of
system RAM in 5-level paging mode which might be bigger than 64TB, then
try to jump to 4-level kernel with the upper limit of 64TB. For this
case, we need add limit for kexec kernel loading if in 5-level kernel.

All this mess makes me hesitate to choose a deligate method. Maybe I
should drop this patchset.

For this issue, if we stop changing the kexec top down searching code,
I am not sure if we should post this replacing with list_head patches
separately.
