But that makes it sound like ordinary streaming DMA from a device to
user space ... that's what the dma_map_xx APIs are already designed to
handle:  I don't understand why you need coherent memory for this (which
can be a scarce resource on some platforms).

Why?  The dma_map_xx API is designed to be zero copy.
