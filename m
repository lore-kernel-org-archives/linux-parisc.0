I've heard those rumours too, and I don't even know if they are true.
Who has a pointer to such a bug report and/or issue? The block layer
itself doesn't not have any such requirements, and the only places where
we play page games is for bio's that were explicitly mapped with pages
by itself (like mapping user data).o

We fix driver crap like that, we don't work around it. It's a BUG.
