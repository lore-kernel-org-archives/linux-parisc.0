this time around it's different, I promise! :)


well...
I guess I can send out a tree wide pf/pF removal patch set. later.
when we will see that .opd based dereference does not make anyone
unhappy.

and I think we can't remove pf/pF from the kernel completely. it
will stay in vscnprintf() for some time. old habits die hard, I suppose,
there might be people using it for debugging/etc.

ok, let me re-spin the series. there are some changes here
and there, so I'll drop Tested-by/Reviewed-by tags and will
ask platforms' maintainers to re-test the patch set :(

if everything goes OK, then we can ask Petr to do the topic
branch (I don't have a kernel.org account).
