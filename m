In kernelspace, both 32 and 64 bit are ll64.

Sorry, I didn't know you support 32 bit userspace only.

However, is this a "new" 64 bit userspace ABI? If yes, you may want to
consider using ll64 in userspace on 64 bit too, like all "new" 64 bit ports
do (arm64, s390, sparc, tile, x86). Only legacy alpha, ia64, mips and
old ppc use l64.

Or follow the ppc64 road:

/*
 * This is here because we used to use l64 for 64bit powerpc
 * and we don't want to impact user mode with our change to ll64
 * in the kernel.
 *
 * However, some user programs are fine with this.  They can
 * flag __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ to get int-ll64.h here.
