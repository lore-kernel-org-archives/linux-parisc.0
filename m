Unfortunately, I have to admit that the VAS segments don't differ from shm* a lot.
The implementation is differently, but the functionality that you can achieve with it
is very similar. I am sorry. We should have looked more closely at the whole
functionality that is provided by the shmem subsystem before working on VAS segments.

However, VAS segments are not the key part of this patch set. The more interesting
functionality in our opinion is the introduction of first class virtual address
spaces and what they can be used for. VAS segments were just another logical step for
us (from first class virtual address spaces to first class virtual address space
segments) but since their functionality can be achieved with various other already
existing features of the Linux kernel, I will probably drop them in future versions
of the patchset.

Thanks
