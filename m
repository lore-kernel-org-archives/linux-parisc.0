Hmm. Looking at the patch a bit more..

So I react to two things:

 - that "else" looks wrong. At least conceptually, both could happen -
the code should be entirely able to handle a segment that expands both
ways (which is something that ia64 could do: stack one way, register
spills etc other, all in just one happy vma). I guess we don't set it
up that way now, but the "else" just annoys my sense of aesthetics.
It's an extra four letters that don't add value - just takes it away.

 - The "address =3D PAGE_ALIGN(address + 1);" thing is just ugly.
Wouldn't it be nicer to just move the earlier

  address &=3D PAGE_MASK

back outside the conditionals (and keep the original conditional the
way it was - you only changed it for that bogus "else" case anyway),
and then do

  if (address + PAGE_SIZE =3D=3D vma->vm_end)

rather than have "PAGE_ALIGN(address + 1)" as yet another way of
aligning the address just right.

No?
