Yeah, on Mac/m68k the RTC is usually handled by a chip that does lots o=
f other
things, so you need to keep the bulk of the code in arch/m68k/ anyway.

Many embedded powerpc boards already have RTC class drivers under drive=
rs/rtc/,
as their RTC chips are sufficiently common.

The ones that don't are mostly "workstation" or "server" type hardware.=
 The
full list is:
  - rtas_set_rtc_time
  - mpc8xx_set_rtc_time
  - beat_get_rtc_time
  - chrp_set_rtc_time
  - iSeries_set_rtc_time
  - maple_set_rtc_time
  - pmac_set_rtc_time
  - ps3_set_rtc_time
