Which is exactly what the XFS code does.  Pages are allocated manually
and we store pointers to the page struct that later get added to the
bio.  But we access them through vmap (which I added exactly for this
reason back in 2002) for kernel accesses.  On all architectures with
sane caches things just work, but for parisc, arm and friends that have
virtually indexed caches we need to make sure to flush caches for this
different access.  The vmalloc linear address is not used for I/O
everywhere.
