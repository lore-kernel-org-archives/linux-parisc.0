OK, so that doesn't make a lot of sense to me; I suspect because you
don't understand what parisc is doing.  These aren't names of linux
special sections ... they're names of function sections.  For
efficiency, we take specific hot functions and place them together in
the linker script so the jumps between them are small enough to be coded
as relative on the 32 bit architecture.  It's really just a more
efficient way of laying out the binary.
