OK, so looking at all of this, that statement's not quite true ... at
least for parisc, we begin the stack where end_of_stack() says the end
should be and so the walker will likely find the next word after the
canary skip occupied and terminate there, so we think the stack is
larger than it really is.  It gets the wrong value, but it will never
even walk out of the stack area.

I agree with this.  Most of it looks easily fixable, but how would I
enable the fix for ia64?  For PA it's simple: I'll just use
CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP, but that won't work for you.
