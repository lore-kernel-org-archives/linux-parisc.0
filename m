My impression was most x86 BIOS's did NOT turn on SERR/PERR when I added
that code to parisc-linux port (2000 or 2001 so) . HPUX was turning on
SERR/PERR and so I was comfortable the HW was stable and it not crash
under normal use unless something was really broken.

There is certainly nothing architectural specific about SERR/PERR.
I felt (at the time) this is more of a case of "if it's not reported to the
user, we won't get blamed for it not working well."
