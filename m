Indeed, the "block: permit I/O to vmalloc/vmap kernel pages" does what
you complain about.  But the series doesn't actually add a user for
that.  What it does in XFS is quite a bit of black magic, too - but only
with the new cache coherence calls that are noops on architectures with
physically indexed caches.

I'm not entirely sure why James added those, but XFS doesn't actually
use bio_map_kern.

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kyle/parisc-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=56c8214b842324e94aa88012010b0f1f9847daec

does it in the caller level.  Not exactly in a beautiful way, but who
am I complain as I'm already lost in our mess of cache coherency APIs.

Kyle/James, can you regenerate the tree without that patch included?
