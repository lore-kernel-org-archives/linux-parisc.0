Thank you for this hint. I can give the new mm_alloc function a different name so
that code that uses the *old* mm_alloc function will fail to compile. I just reused
the old name when I wrote the code, because mm_alloc was only used in very few
locations in the kernel (2 times in the whole kernel source) which made identifying
and changing them very easy. I also don't think that there will be many users in the
kernel for mm_alloc in the future because it is a relatively low level data
structure. But if it is better to use a different name for the new function, I am
very happy to change this.
