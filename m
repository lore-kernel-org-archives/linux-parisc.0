The problem was indeed never reported upstream but it does in fact
manifest as a null pointer dereference, and happens in a discontiguous
memory context on m68k. I'm uncertain as to whether I had tracked the
exact source of the null pointer, I need to check my notes on this.

Reverting the commit in question makes SLUB behave as though NUMA was
defined, so this all checks out.

Apologies for not escalating this beyond m68k, and thanks to Geert for
spotting the connection.

Cheers,

  Michael
