Yes. The fix I sent out was a call to invalidate_kernel_vmap_range(),
which takes care of invalidating the cache prior to a virtual address
read.

My question was specifically about the write through the regular kernel
mapping: according to Russell and my reading of the cachetlb.txt
documentation, flush_dcache_page() is only guaranteed to have an effect
on page cache pages.
flush_kernel_dcache_page() (not to be confused with flush_dcache_page)
would appear to be the closest fit according to my reading of the
documentation, however the ARM implementation appears to be a no-op...
