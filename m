    I'm wondering about the other drivers that check the channel enable bits in 
their prereset() methods. James has shown that such code would still crash on 
such platforms as PARISC (I suspect many more platfroms which don't silently 
ignore the target aborts in the PCI space like x86 does). I think all such 
drivers should be converted to the early port disable detection scheme used in 
the pata_cmd64x driver (an some others)...
