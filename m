the only reason Blackfin was converted quickly is because the code
issues a warning (that has been there for a long time):
# warning __do_IRQ is deprecated. Please convert to proper flow handler=
s

so i guess you're saying that you disable the "ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED"
option ?  or you dont pay attention to warnings when compiling kernels
?
