ARM does this because there is nothing else which would do that - which
means devices behind bridges would be completely inaccessible.

ARM also does this, unless pdev_bad_for_parity(dev) is true.  See
ARMs pcibios_fixup_bus().

I suspect they're architecture specific; I wouldn't like to do either
on x86, but they're either required or preferred on ARM.
