unistd_32.h, unistd_64.h, syscall_table_32.h, syscall_table_64.h and
syscall_table_c32.h
are generated files. unistd.h and syscall_table.S file include
generated files. I had the
support to keep the comments in the generated files.

Eg:- from github
https://github.com/frzkhn/system_call_table_generator/blob/5fe5fb5a3ad457b234e7600d8a4b61b2e3629acd/ia64/syscall.tbl#L105

But I got to know the generated file don't carry any license info and
comment section. That's
why I removed it from all architecture.

I'm ok to keep this support for all architecture. Please feel free to
comment here.

Sure. I can do this thing. The above one may be applicable for parisc not other
architecture. So the scripts might be slightly different. If we keep a
standard way,
the script will be unique. So the only difference will be Makefile and
.tbl files for all
architecture; I think that is our one of the goal.

Sure. I was wondering why the checkpatch script is not catching this one.
Where ever I came across I fixed it.
