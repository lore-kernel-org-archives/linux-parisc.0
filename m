Sounds like the old SKAS feature for UML.

This sounds rather complicated.  Getting TLB flushing right seems
tricky.  Why not just map the same thing into multiple mms?

The solution here is IMO to fix the scheduler.

Also, FWIW, I have patches (that need a little work) that will make
switch_mm() waaaay faster on x86.

Ick.  Please don't do this.  Can we please keep an mm as just an mm
and not make it look magically different depending on which process
maps it?  If you need a trampoline (which you do, of course), just
write a trampoline in regular user code and map it manually.
