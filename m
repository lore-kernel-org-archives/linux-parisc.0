I think we should fix it, even if we now break the ABI.

It's about a "conditional trap" which needs to be handled by userspace.
I doubt there is any Linux code out which is utilizing this
parisc-specific trap.

I'd suggest to add a new FPE trap si_code (e.g. FPE_CONDTRAP).
While at it, maybe we should include the already existing FPE_MDAOVF
from the frv architecture, so that arch/frv/include/uapi/asm/siginfo.h
can go completely.

Suggested patch is below.

I'm willing to test the patch below on the parisc architecture for a few
weeks. And it will break arch/x86/kernel/signal_compat.c which needs
looking at then too.

Thoughts?

[PATCH] parisc: Add FPE_CONDTRAP for conditional trap handling

Posix and common sense requires that SI_USER not be a signal specific
si_code.  Thus add a new FPE_CONDTRAP si_code for conditional traps.
