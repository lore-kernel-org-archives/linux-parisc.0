The architecturally prescribed fix for this on parisc is to purge the
TLB entry as well.  Without a TLB entry, the CPU is forbidden from doing
speculative reads.  This obviously works only as long as the kernel
never touches the page during DMA, of course ...

Isn't this also true for arm?

Actually, there's a more fundamental problem.  I did think of doing it
this way initially.  However, most of the dma_map..() cases come down
from block and have already lost all idea of what the virtual address
was and where it came from ... so there's an awful lot more work to do
to make them carry it through to dma_map...()

Well, the good news is that I can fix it to work on parisc.
